//create variable named kelvin and assign it the value of 293

//create another variable that converts kelvin to celcius, name it celcius
const celcius = kelvin - 273;

//create another variable that converts celcius to newton, name it newton
let newton = celcius * (33/100);
//use the Math.floor() javascript method to turn newton into a rounded number (if it ends up a decimal number)
newton = Math.floor(newton);
//create a variable that can change that gives the value in fahrenheit, named fahrenheit
let fahrenheit = celcius * (9/5) + 32;

//use the Math.floor() javascript method to turn fahrenheit into a rounded number (if it ends up a decimal number)
